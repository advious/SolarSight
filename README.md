# SolarSight

A Deep Learning-based solar energy prediction tool.

## Description:

Renewable energy is critical for reducing the global carbon footprint and saving the planet. Accurate prediction of renewable energy at various times **beforehand** is vital because:
 - The amount of non-renewable energy generation depends on energy that would come from renewable energy sources
 - Accurate prediction makes flexible energy production from various sources commercially feasible and integratable with the grid 
 - Accurate prediction of non-renewable energy prevents wasteful excess production and reduces cost

Solar energy is the most abundant renewable energy. However, predicting accurate solar energy production is challenging as a result of fluctuations in production due to changing environmental factors such as solar radiation, wind speed, air temperature, etc. Estimating output from a solar grid is very difficult for a human operator to predict as it depends on many factors. Machine Learning (ML) models can learn from past input and output (dataset) with higher accuracy than humans. In this project, I have used a deep neural network architecture named Neural Basis Expansion Analysis for Interpretable Time Series Forecasting (N-BEATS) algorithm to predict future energy. The test results demonstrate that the average mean error is less than 1.5% of the generated peak solar power.
